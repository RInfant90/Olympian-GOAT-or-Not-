Showcasing an old project

This was an SQL Team project in which we were assigned the Olympian Florence Griffith Joyner.  
We were provided the Olympics data, and instructed to write SQL queries to answer the history of the athlete.
We exported the result tables from dBeaver and imported them into Excel for further analysis and visualization.
We prepared a presentation to explain the questions we asked and answered with the data.
In the presenation we told the story of the athlete using tables and visualizations to support the story.
Based on our findings we had to determine if she was the Olympic GOAT (greateast of all time) of Track and Field.
