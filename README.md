Showcasing an old project

This was an SQL Team project in which we were assigned the research of the Olympian Florence Griffith Joyner.  Based on our findings we had to determine if she was the Olympic GOAT (greateast of all time) of Track and Field.
- Using the Olympics data, we wrote SQL queries to answer the history of the athlete.
- We exported the query results from dBeaver and imported them into Excel for further analysis and visualization.
- We prepared a presentation to explain the questions we asked and answered with the data.
- In the presentation we told the story of the athlete using tables and visualizations to support the story.
