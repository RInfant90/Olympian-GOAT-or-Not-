# my_old_project
Showcasing an old project

Today I worked on Git vs GitHub and learned to:
- Create a repository for an old project
- Cloned it in Git
- Made 2 directories in the old project
- Added a presentation and file
- In Git I moved the files into the correct folders
- added, commit, and pushed the files to GitHub
- In GitHub I summarized my tasks
